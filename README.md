AWT Project WS24/25 Group: Adaptive Learning Analytics Dashboard [1]

## Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of the AWT course for WS24/25, focuses on creating an Adaptive Learning Analytics Dashboard. Specifically, our objective is to develop metrics and indicators that support stakeholders in the teaching/learning process to gain deeper insights, e.g., regarding knowledge levels, learning progress, and
learning needs. This will be consolidated into a dashboard prototype where action instructions and recommendations for involvement based on these metrics and indicators in the context of the user are generated. 
Interoperable standards are utilized.
